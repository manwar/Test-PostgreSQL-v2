=head1 NAME

Test::DBIx::Class::SchemaManager::Trait::Testpostgresqlv2 - Use Test::PostgreSQL::v2 as the database backend for Test::DBIx::Class

=head1 VERSION

Version 2.03

=head1 SYNOPSIS

In your test file:

    use Test::More;
    use Test::DBIx::Class {
        schema_class => 'MyApp::Schema',
        traits       => ['Testpostgresqlv2'],
        deploy_db    => 1,
    }, qw/:resultsets/;

    ok my $user = ResultSet('User')->create({ name => 'John' }), 'Created user';
    is $user->name, 'John', 'Name persisted correctly';

    done_testing;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This L<Moose::Role> is a trait for L<Test::DBIx::Class::SchemaManager> that
transparently replaces the legacy C<Testpostgresql> trait. Instead of relying
on the aging L<Test::PostgreSQL> module, it spins up a temporary PostgreSQL
instance using L<Test::PostgreSQL::v2>, which is designed for modern Linux
environments (Ubuntu 22.04+, Debian Bookworm, and similar distributions) that
restrict writes to system socket directories such as C</var/run/postgresql>.

When the trait is activated via the C<traits> key in L<Test::DBIx::Class>'s
configuration hash, the schema manager calls C<get_default_connect_info>
during its own initialisation phase. This trait overrides that method to:

=over 4

=item 1.

Instantiate a L<Test::PostgreSQL::v2> object, which handles binary discovery,
temporary directory creation, C<initdb>, and process management automatically.

=item 2.

Store the live instance on the schema manager object so the PostgreSQL process
is kept alive for the entire duration of the test run.

=item 3.

Return a L<DBI>-compatible connection array-ref (DSN, username, password, and
attributes) for L<Test::DBIx::Class> to use when connecting to the schema.

=back

The temporary PostgreSQL instance, including all data files, configuration,
and logs, is automatically removed when the test process exits, because
L<Test::PostgreSQL::v2> uses L<File::Temp> with C<CLEANUP =E<gt> 1>.

=head1 INTEGRATION

=head2 Replacing the legacy Testpostgresql trait

If you are already using L<Test::DBIx::Class> with the C<Testpostgresql>
trait, migration is a one-line change:

    # Before
    traits => ['Testpostgresql'],

    # After
    traits => ['Testpostgresqlv2'],

No other changes to your test files are required.

=head2 Trait discovery

L<Test::DBIx::Class> maps trait names to packages by prepending
C<Test::DBIx::Class::SchemaManager::Trait::>. The trait name
C<Testpostgresqlv2> therefore resolves to this package. Ensure the file
is on Perl's C<@INC>, typically by placing it under C<lib/> in your
distribution or under C<t/lib/> for test-only use.

=head2 Passing extra options to Test::PostgreSQL::v2

The current implementation uses the default L<Test::PostgreSQL::v2>
constructor. If you need to customise the PostgreSQL instance (for example,
to bind to a specific port or host), subclass this trait and override
C<get_default_connect_info> accordingly.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 get_default_connect_info

    my $connect_info = $self->get_default_connect_info;

Called internally by L<Test::DBIx::Class::SchemaManager> during schema
initialisation. Starts a temporary PostgreSQL instance via
L<Test::PostgreSQL::v2> and returns a four-element array-ref suitable for
passing directly to L<DBI/connect>:

    [ $dsn, $user, $password, \%dbi_attributes ]

The C<AutoCommit> attribute is set to C<1> by default, matching the behaviour
expected by L<DBIx::Class>.

Dies with a descriptive message (including the content of
C<$Test::PostgreSQL::v2::errstr>) if the PostgreSQL instance cannot be
started.

B<Note:> This method is an extension point defined by
L<Test::DBIx::Class::SchemaManager>. It is not part of the public API of this
trait and should not be called directly from test code.

sub get_default_connect_info {
    my ($self) = @_;

    my $pg = Test::PostgreSQL::v2->new()
        or die "Could not start PostgreSQL: $Test::PostgreSQL::v2::errstr";

    # Stash on the object as a plain hash key — no Moose 'has' needed
    $self->{_pg} = $pg;

    return [ $pg->dsn, $pg->user, '', { AutoCommit => 1 } ];
};

after 'cleanup' => sub {
    my ($self) = @_;

    # Disconnect schema storage before PostgreSQL process is killed
    if ( $self->schema
      && $self->schema->storage
      && $self->schema->storage->connected ) {
        local $@;
        eval { $self->schema->storage->disconnect };
    }

    # Now safe to let the PostgreSQL instance go
    delete $self->{_pg};
};

=head1 DEPENDENCIES

=over 4

=item * L<Moose::Role>

Required to participate in the L<Test::DBIx::Class::SchemaManager> trait
composition system. L<Moose> is already a dependency of
L<Test::DBIx::Class>, so no additional installation is needed.

=item * L<Test::PostgreSQL::v2>

The modern PostgreSQL test instance manager that this trait wraps. Must be
installed separately. See L<Test::PostgreSQL::v2> for full prerequisites,
including a working PostgreSQL installation (C<initdb> and C<postgres>
binaries must be discoverable via C<$PATH> or C<POSTGRES_HOME>).

=item * L<DBD::Pg>

Required at runtime by L<DBIx::Class> to connect to the PostgreSQL instance.
Must be installed separately.

=back

=head1 SEE ALSO

=over 4

=item * L<Test::PostgreSQL::v2>

The backend module this trait wraps.

=item * L<Test::DBIx::Class>

The testing framework this trait integrates with.

=item * L<Test::DBIx::Class::SchemaManager::Trait::Testpostgresql>

The legacy trait this module replaces.
