=head1 NAME

Test::PostgreSQL::v2 - A modern, isolated PostgreSQL executable runner for tests

=head1 VERSION

Version 2.03

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use DBI;
    use Test::PostgreSQL::v2;

    # Start a temporary PostgreSQL instance
    my $pg = Test::PostgreSQL::v2->new()
        or die $Test::PostgreSQL::v2::errstr;

    # Connect directly with DBI
    my $dbh = DBI->connect($pg->dsn, $pg->user, '')
        or die $DBI::errstr;

    $dbh->do("CREATE TABLE foo (id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT)");
    $dbh->disconnect;

    # The instance is automatically stopped and cleaned up when $pg goes out of scope

=head2 Usage with Test::DBIx::Class

The recommended way to use this module with L<Test::DBIx::Class> is via the
bundled C<Testpostgresqlv2> trait, which handles all lifecycle and
compile-time scoping automatically:

    use Test::More;
    use Test::DBIx::Class {
        schema_class => 'MyApp::Schema',
        traits       => ['Testpostgresqlv2'],
        deploy_db    => 1,
    }, qw/:resultsets/;

    ok ResultSet('User')->create({ name => 'John' }), 'Created user';

    done_testing;

If you need manual control over the connection instead, you must start the
instance at compile time to satisfy C<use Test::DBIx::Class>'s import phase:

    use Test::More;

    our $pg;
    BEGIN {
        require Test::PostgreSQL::v2;
        $pg = Test::PostgreSQL::v2->new()
            or die $Test::PostgreSQL::v2::errstr;
    }

    use Test::DBIx::Class {
        schema_class => 'MyApp::Schema',
        connect_info => [ $pg->dsn, $pg->user, '' ],
        deploy_db    => 1,
    }, qw/:resultsets/;

    done_testing;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<Test::PostgreSQL::v2> is a "clean sheet" rewrite designed to replace the
aging L<Test::PostgreSQL>. It addresses modern Linux environment constraints
(like Ubuntu 24.04+) by isolating sockets in temporary directories and
correctly discovering modern Postgres binaries.

=head2 CONSTRUCTOR

B<new(%args)>

The C<new> method initialises and starts a temporary PostgreSQL instance. It
performs the following steps:

=over 4

=item 1. Binary Discovery: Searches for C<initdb> and C<postgres>
(or C<postmaster>). It respects the C<POSTGRES_HOME> environment variable
if set, falling back to the system C<PATH>.

=item 2. Workspace Isolation: Creates a unique C<tempdir> for the data
cluster and unix sockets (via the C<-k> flag). This avoids permission
conflicts with system-wide PostgreSQL socket directories like
C</var/run/postgresql>.

=item 3. Automatic Port Selection: If no port is provided, it dynamically
searches for an available port on the specified host.

=item 4. Cluster Initialisation: Runs C<initdb> with C<trust>
authentication and C<--nosync> for maximum test performance.

=item 5. Daemonisation & Readiness: Forks the server process and polls
the host/port until the instance is ready to accept connections. If the
server fails to start, it slurps the C<pg.log> into a C<croak> message for
immediate debugging.

=back

B<Arguments:>

=over 4

=item * C<host> (Default: 127.0.0.1)

The bind address for the server.

=item * C<port> (Default: Auto-selected)

The TCP port to listen on.

=item * C<user> (Default: 'postgres')

The superuser name to be created during C<initdb>.

=back

B<Returns:> A C<Test::PostgreSQL::v2> object.

=head1 CAVEATS

=head2 Process Management

The PostgreSQL server process is tied to the lifecycle of the Perl object.
When the object goes out of scope, the C<DESTROY> method attempts a
C<SIGTERM>, waits up to 5 seconds for a clean shutdown, and falls back to
C<SIGKILL> if the process remains stubborn.

If the Perl interpreter crashes via C<SIGKILL> or an abrupt C<BAIL_OUT>,
the background PostgreSQL process may remain running (orphaned). Always
ensure your test runner handles cleanup or use a process supervisor in CI
environments.

=head2 Data Persistence

This module uses L<File::Temp> with C<CLEANUP =E<gt> 1>. All database data,
configuration files, and logs are B<permanently deleted> when the object is
destroyed. This is intentional for unit testing but makes the module
unsuitable for persistent local development databases.

=head1 ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

=head2 POSTGRES_HOME

If set, the module will look for C<initdb> and C<postgres> binaries in
C<$POSTGRES_HOME/bin>. This is useful for testing against specific versions
of PostgreSQL installed in non-standard locations (e.g., C</usr/lib/postgresql/16/>).

=head1 SEE ALSO

=over 4

=item * L<Test::PostgreSQL>

The original inspiration for this module. While it served the community for years,
it may struggle with modern Linux socket permissions and binary naming conventions
addressed here in C<Test::PostgreSQL::v2>.

=item * L<Test::DBIx::Class>

The gold standard for ORM-based testing. C<Test::PostgreSQL::v2> is designed to
be a reliable backend engine for C<Test::DBIx::Class> configurations.

=item * L<DateTime::Format::Pg>

Essential for handling PostgreSQL-specific date and time formats. Verified
compatible with this module's data handling in integration tests.

=item * L<DBI> and L<DBD::Pg>

The underlying database interface and driver required to communicate with
the instances spawned by this module.
